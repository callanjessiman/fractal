# fractal

A Java program for rendering fractals, which I began (in C++) in high school, ported to Java during my undergrad, and then made half-finished changes to until it didn't work any more and I'd forgotten what the problem was. Now, I'm re-writing it with version control, mostly to learn how to use Git/GitHub, but also to have a well-functioning version of it that I can add to without completely breaking.

Currently, the program renders the Mandelbrot fractal with parallelization, mapping escape iterations logarithmically to a cyclic color scheme. Click to pan, scroll to zoom, use the spinners in the sidebar to change the maximum number of iterations and rotate the view. The program is configured as an Eclipse project.
