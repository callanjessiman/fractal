# fractal

A Java program for rendering fractals, which I began (in C++) in grade 12, ported to Java during my undergrad, and made half-finished changes to until it didn't work any more and I'd forgotten what the problem was. Now, I'm re-writing it with version control, mostly to learn how to use Git/GutHub.

Currently, the program only renders the Mandelbrot fractal, and simply maps escape iterations (up to 1000) to a cyclic greyscale color scheme. Click to pan; scroll the mouse wheel to zoom.
