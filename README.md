# fractal

A Java program for rendering fractals, which I began (in C++) in high school, ported to Java during my undergrad, and then made half-finished changes to until it didn't work any more and I'd forgotten what the problem was. Now, I'm re-writing it with version control, mostly to learn how to use Git/GitHub, but also to have a well-functioning version of it that I can add to without completely breaking.

Currently, the program only renders the Mandelbrot fractal, and simply maps escape iterations (up to 1000) in a linear fashion to a cyclic greyscale color scheme. Click to pan; scroll the mouse wheel to zoom.
